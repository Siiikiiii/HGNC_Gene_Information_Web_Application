# HGNC Gene Information Web Application

This Flask project is designed to provide clinical scientists and researchers with a simple web application for querying standardised human gene nomenclature data.

Users enter a gene symbol (for example, `BRCA2`) or an HGNC ID (for example, `HGNC:1100`) and the application displays the corresponding:

- HGNC gene symbol
- HGNC ID
- Gene name
- Previous gene symbols
- Previous gene names
- Gene aliases/synonyms
- MANE Select transcript

---

# Data source

The application uses a locally stored copy of the complete HGNC dataset, which is publicly available from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC):

https://www.genenames.org/download/archive/

The downloaded TSV (tab-separated values) file should be saved as `hgnc_complete_set.txt` and placed in the `data/` directory at the root of the project. 

The application loads this dataset upon startup, making it fast and efficient for querying gene records without needing an external API connection. The specific file loaded can be configured in:

hgnc_app/settings.py

# Project architecture

This project is intentionally lightweight and is intended both as a useful application and as a clear example of a small Flask application structure.

Unlike larger Flask projects, the application does not use a database or ORM. Instead, the TSV dataset is parsed into memory using standard Python libraries during application startup, and all searches are performed against this in-memory data.

The request flow is straightforward:

# Installation

This project uses a fully controlled and reproducible Conda environment.

## 1. Create the Conda environment

conda env create -f environment.yml

## 2. Activate the environment

conda activate <your_environment_name>

*(Note: Replace <your_environment_name> with the name specified at the top of your environment.yml file).*

## 3. Install the project

pip install -e .

The editable installation (-e) allows changes made to the source code to be immediately reflected without reinstalling the package.

# Running the application

Start the Flask development server with:

python -m hgnc_app.app

The application will be live and accessible in your web browser at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

---

# Testing

Run the complete unit and route test suite:

pytest -v

Run the test suite with coverage to generate a detailed HTML report:

pytest \
    --cov=hgnc_app \
    --cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered \
    --cov-report=html

An interactive HTML coverage report will be generated. You can view it by opening this file in your browser:

htmlcov/index.html

---

# Shutting down

Stop the Flask development server in your terminal using:

Ctrl+C

Deactivate the Conda environment when finished:

conda deactivate

---

# Notes on reproducibility

This project is intended for clinical and educational use and therefore prioritises reproducibility.

- The Conda environment (environment.yml) fixes the Python interpreter version.
- All Python dependencies are configured in pyproject.toml and pinned in requirements.txt.
- Installation is deterministic across systems.
- Templates and static assets are packaged with the application.
- The complete test suite can be executed using pytest to verify correct installation and application logic.
